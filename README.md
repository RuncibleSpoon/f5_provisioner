# F5 AUTOMATION PROVISIONER

## Overview
The F5_Provisioner is a part of the automation sandbox. This is built by F5 Business Development organization and is based on the F5/Ansible workshop provisioner. 

## How to use?
 Follow [F5 Ansible AWS Provisioner](provisioner) for detailed steps to spin up and tear down the sandbox infrastructure using provisioner

## So What?
With F5 Automation provisioner, users are provided with an **F5 + Ansible** sandbox fully configured in the cloud. This can currently deploy infrastructure pieces like F5 BIG-IP, Webservers, Ansible nodes etc (more features will be added soon) in AWS cloud.

Once the necessary infrastructure is deployed using the provisioner, users will be able to try out various automation scenarios using the use-case templates in the f5alliances repo. 

The Automation Sandbox can be used:
- as a self learning tool to get familiar with Ansible Automation for F5
- to build demos and proof of concepts
- to find automation solutions for common customer use-cases.
